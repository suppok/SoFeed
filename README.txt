For Aj. to run this app

1. Run the app.
2. You go to login page.
3. You must go to register page by click Register button.
4. For username and password, you can type anything you need. 
   But about the username and password of facebook, twitter and instagram,
   you should set type like this

	Twitter    username : twitter1
	Twitter    password : 123456

	Instagram  password : 123456
	
	***Because I can't use the real API of these social. 
	I have to build some data.
5. After you regis, you login with your username and password.
6. You come to Facebook page with timeline.
7. You can post on Facebook by clicking on top-right button and click Post
8. Type anything you need and then post.
9. Or you can switch to Twitter or Instagram by clicking the same button and choose.
10. If you rerun application, you have to register before signin again because I didn't use shared preference for saving data.
